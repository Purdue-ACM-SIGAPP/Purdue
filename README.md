# Purdue App

This is the official Purdue Application for Purdue University.
Developed by 2014-2015 Purdue ACM SIGAPP Members and currently available on the
[Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.purdue.app).

# Contributing

We follow the Github Flow model of development.
If you would like to contribute to this project, just fork it on Github then file a pull request.
We'd also love if you'd come by SIGAPP meetings every T/R at 7pm in LWSN B148!

# Style

*Under Development*

## Package Names

Classes which might be shared between parts of the app will exist in general packages,
whereas classes which are specific to one part should exist in an appropriately named
package for that part.

For example, a MainMenuAdapter would only be used for the main menu, so it is in the
`mainmenu` package. But a NoInternetDialog might be used in multiple places, so it goes in the
`dialogs` package.

Effort should be made to make your contributions as generic as possible in order to
maximize code reuse and also maintain a consistent visual style throughout
the application.

`utility` is a general package for primarily static methods which might be used anywhere in
 the project.
